#probe_nozzle_x: 400
#probe_nozzle_y: 394
nozzle_xy_position: 400,394
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the
#   Z endstop.
#probe_switch_x: 394.0
#probe_switch_y: 372.0
switch_xy_position: 394.0,372.0
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch
#   on the Z endstop.
#probe_bed_x: 314.0
#probe_bed_y: 143.0
bed_xy_position:314.0,143.0
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.
switch_offset: 0.685
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
max_deviation: 1.5
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
samples: 5
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance: 0.006
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance_retries: 10
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: median
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 5
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
position_min: -5
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 300
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
lift_speed: 20
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
probing_speed: 5
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: 2
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: 2.5
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: true
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
